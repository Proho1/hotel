        <p>The history of hotels is intimately connected to that of civilisations. Or rather, it is a part of that history. Facilities offering guests hospitality have been in evidence since early biblical times. The Greeks developed thermal baths in villages designed for rest and recuperation. Later, the Romans built mansions to provide accommodation for travellers on government business.</p>

        <p>The hospitality and services provided by each staff of the hotel were excellent, they attended us well at all times and we were impressed by their courtesy. We enjoyed our stay and convey thanks to all associated with the hotel. Special thanks to Khun Gap, who took very good care of our group since the inspection day until the end of the trip. We really appreciate ka. We hope to come again soon.</p>

          <p>The hotel is meticulous in its planning, providing excellent d√©cor, signage and the like. Importantly, they never seemed to tire of the constant emails from an equally meticulous event manager. Always prompt and attentive.</p>
